2. Syntax:
The words - predefined tokens are specified between " and ":
a) Syntactical rules:
	- program = "statements_seq"
	- statements_seq = statement {statement}
	- statement = declaration | simple_statement | struct_statement
	- declaration = type identifier
	- type = ("integer" | "char" | "string") | array_type
	- array_type = ("integer" | "char" | "string") "[" number "]"
	- simple_statement = assignment_statement | io_statement
	- struct_statement = if_statement | for_statement | while_statement
	- compound_statement = "START" statement_seq "END"
	- assignment_statement = identifier "=" expression
	- expression = term | expression op expression
	- term = identifier | number | string
	- op = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
	- io_statement = "puts" "(" identifier ")" | "puts" "(" const ")"
	- if_statement = "if" condition statement {elsif condition statement} [else statement]
	- for_statement = "for" assignment_statement; condition; statement
	- while_statement = "while" condition compound_statement
	- condition = expression relation expression
	- relation = "<" | "<=" | "==" | "!=" | ">=" | ">"
